# daily-planner

I built this project as a simple tool to allow a user to keep an up to date record of their daily schedule.  This is a good tool for professionals to manage their calander and delegate tasks.  It was an interesting project that forced me to intertwine HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create one finalized, working application.  It has a nice minimalist design which will not distract users from completing the tasks at hand.  It also has a save function, saved to the local storage to allow a user to come back to my application and complete tasks that had been previously submitted.  Below you will find a link to the deployed application and a screenshot of the page.
